This is a simple blogging template for the  [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) CMS. If you're not familiar with Siteleaf, think of it as a web-based static site generator that's easy enough for your non-technical clients to use.

**You build the template, then let them manage the content in Siteleaf**, publishing out static files to FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud, Siteleaf hosting, or even Github Pages.

Developing for it is [super simple](http://vimeo.com/70121781), there's a ruby gem that lets you build projects locallyâ€”using all your favorite [preprocessors](http://sass-lang.com) and [servers](http://pow.cx).

Templating is done with the delightfully easy to use  [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) engine.

You can grab a copy of this template [here](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/frameleafs). To use it as is, just upload it to your theme folder in Siteleaf, and then follow the Site Setup directions below.

The layout uses a heavily modified grid from the [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com) anti framework.
