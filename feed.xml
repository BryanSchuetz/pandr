      <description>&lt;p&gt;In June, P&amp;amp;R organized and launched the first One Health platforms in West Africa. The platform launches are the result of the continuous P&amp;amp;R, USAID, and EPT-2 support in West Africa to the One Health approach – through technical guidance, multistakeholder facilitation, and collaborative institutional capacity building - since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, June 23, Sierra Leone Vice President Dr. Victor Bockarie Foh joined the Ministry of Health and Sanitation; the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security; the Environmental Protection Agency; and Office of National Security to launch the platform at a half-day event in Freetown. While delivering the keynote, Vice President Foh expressed his excitement at being part of history-making event, and congratulated the Ministry partners for taking the nation one step further to a country free of zoonotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three decades, more than 75% of new human diseases are of animal origin. “This is a disturbing development to the human race, particularly for developing countries, where challenges in our healthcare delivery systems persist,” said Vice President Foh.
The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency officially launched the platform, to be chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Brima Kargbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, June 28, Liberia launched the country&amp;rsquo;s One Health platform in Monrovia, during an event ending with a signing of a declaration of commitment to the institutionalization of One Health. The signing was endorsed by nine Government of Liberia ministers – Health, Agriculture, Internal Affairs (National Disaster Management Agency), Education, Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Industry, Information, Defense, and Justice – as well as the heads of the Forestry Development Authority, Environmental Protection Agency and the National Public Health Institute. The Vice President of Liberia serves as chair of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Liberia platform represents a milestone in the Liberia Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) roadmap, creates momentum for the institutionalization of One Health, and underscores the commitment of the Government of Liberia to better address public health threats. Other international partners such as the Word Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the PREDICT project and the World Bank also participated in platform development and launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was preceded by a meeting of technical directors to review the status of the One Health Implementation in the country. During the one-day meeting, directors presented the One Health institutional framework and Terms of Reference of the platform for final endorsement and review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the 3rd International Global Health Security Agenda Zoonotic Disease Action Package (GHSA ZDAP International Conference in August 2017, P&amp;amp;R and the Vietnam One Health Partnership for Zoonoses supported key government representatives from Indonesia and Vietnam in convening a joint preparation meeting and exchange visit on May 29-31 in Jakarta. Indonesia and Vietnam, with the recent addition of Senegal, are global co leading countries for GHSA ZDAP. The meeting was held to advance logistics planning as well as review the draft Terms of Reference for the ZDAP Coordination Mechanism that will be presented at the event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this two-and-a-half-day meeting, the Indonesia and Vietnam delegations also shared experiences in zoonotic control and communication. P&amp;amp;R has supported Indonesia’s Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture (Kemenko PMK in developing and piloting One Health Coordination Guidelines which lay out the coordination and responsibilities of various ministries and agencies in responding to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, during both outbreak and “peacetime” situations. The Vietnam delegation also visited the Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, which operates monitoring and coordination mechanisms to prepare and respond to both natural and  non-natural disasters. The respective delegations also discussed ways to work together in an integrated approach to effectively control and prevent zoonosis outbreak and epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R worked closely with USAID and the CDC to support Rwanda’s National One Health Steering Committee in planning and organizing a One Health Zoonotic Disease prioritization workshop that took place on June 20, 2017. The two-day exercise engaged several stakeholders and representatives from the animal, human, and environment sectors in applying a multi-sectoral One Health approach to identifying Rwanda’s priority endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the CDC prioritization tool, Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza (HPAI), Rift Valley Fever, Brucellosis, Human Sleeping sickness, Rabies and Viral Hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) were all identified as major public health threats in Rwanda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees discussed the need for joint interventions by the human, animal and environmental health ministries to prevent and mitigate disease outbreak in the country. P&amp;amp;R, alongside key participants and 12 voting members from the lead OH sectors, developed a 5-criteria key for the prioritizing the zoonotic diseases. The criteria included assessments of disease severity and epidemic, pandemic &amp;amp; bioterrorism potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of this two-day workshop in Rubavu, participants identified and agreed on key areas of improvement in strengthening multisector engagements, surveillance, detection, prevention and control strategies against Rwanda’s One Health priority zoonotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/joint-external-evaluation-ghsa-support</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uganda recently held a Joint External Evaluation Exercise to assess its capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health threats. P&amp;amp;R was present to provide technical assistance throughout the  5-day event which was organized in close collaboration with One Health government sectors and partners including, WHO, CDC, and USAID. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uganda’s Minister of State for Health, Hon. Sarah Opendi, opened up the meeting promising evaluators an honest and open assessment, which would help the government identify gaps, challenges and measures of strengthening and improving public health systems in the country. 19 Technical Areas (TA) were assessed during the evaluation exercise  on how well their attributes were being implemented.  P&amp;amp;R took the lead alongside Uganda’s National One Health Platform in supporting the country’s Zoonotic Diseases Coordination Office (ZDCO) to conduct both internal and external evaluations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the JEE exercise, a number of recommendations were made for moving One Health forward in Uganda. These recommendations included the development of a national One Health Policy to guide and support implementation of One Health at National and Sub-national/district levels, and the development of a formal integrated real time zoonosis data sharing and joint outbreak response mechanism in various agencies, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID emphasized the need to improve collaboration between all sectors by improving and strengthening the One Health approach and Platform in preparation for the upcoming global GHSA ministerial conference that is taking place in October 2017 in Kampala.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In joint collaboration with the National Zoonosis Control Program, P&amp;amp;R held a training workshop on April 20th aimed at supporting the government of Cameroon in their efforts to establish Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs). The Animal Health (MINEPIA), Human Health (MINSANTE), and Territorial Administration (MINATD) ministries were all present at this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop highlighted the need to share information for more efficient response to public health events and the necessity to resolve leadership problems in the dissemination of information. P&amp;amp;R shared the importance of collaboration between the health and animal EOCs for better prevention, detection and response to public health events, using the practical example of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, H5H1 that broke out in Cameroon in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants learned about EOCs, their roles and responsibilities before, during and after an epidemic. The Ministry representatives also gained knowledge on the technical and institutional aspects that constitute the desired collaboration between the different operation centers. At the end of the workshop, recommendations were made for the development of a legislative and regulatory framework for establishing EOCs. This training was a big step forward for the realization of the GHSA roadmap in Cameroon and P&amp;amp;R hopes to hold more of such workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The West African Health Organization (WAHO) recently held a  workshop in Abidjan to train individuals for a Côte d’Ivoire National Rapid Response Team. P&amp;amp;R joined other technical partners to support  WAHO in reviewing the training curriculum and co-facilitating the training of National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) with a focus on One Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cote d’Ivoire NRRT will be mobilized as part of an ECOWAS’ Regional Rapid Response Team (ERRT) to compensate for a lack of skilled human resources in epidemics management in the West African region. The NRRT includes professionals from various sectors who will serve as first responders in the case of any public health event in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R reviewed the content of training exercises related to the development of SITREPs, risk analysis, and epidemiological investigations. The workshop included a One Health session which highlighted the  approach, vision and results in Africa and Asia through National One Health Platforms (NOHPs). P&amp;amp;R also presented the benefits of having multisector teams in the prevention and response to public health events and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cote d’Ivoire training  was a pilot test and will be used to  adjust the training material for other countries. P&amp;amp;R will continue to provide technical support to WAHO through the facilitation of One Health sessions in several West African countries and assist in identifying activities where technical advice and support is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uganda Rolls Out One Health Strategy Development Process</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/uganda-rolls-out-one-health-strategy-planning-development-process</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 30, 2017, P&amp;amp;R facilitated a three-day One Health Strategy Development Workshop with the Uganda Zoonotic Disease Coordination Office (ZDCO). The workshop was conducted in response to the need for more well-defined collaborative activities between representatives from the human, animal and environmental health sectors under the Uganda National One Health Platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s multi-sector platform was launched on November 2016 to prevent, detect and respond to existing zoonotic diseases and emerging pandemic threats. Since the launch of the platform, the sectors have tried to collaborate in accordance with the memorandum of understanding. However, there was an urgent need to have a national one health strategic plan which adequately highlighted the vision, mission, policy priorities, and joint collaborative activities of the One Health effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R initiated the preparatory process of this strategic plan development event with EPT-2/Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) partners and other relevant stakeholders. P&amp;amp;R also secured the services of a local facilitator to conduct a literature review of all background materials relevant to the development of the strategic plan and to outline an activity implementation timeline. One Health stakeholders, including representatives of Uganda’s key  Ministries and partner institutions such as the CDC and WHO contributed to the One Health strategic plan draft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The One Health strategic plan is expected to be finalized in September 2017 after it has been reviewed by stakeholders and endorsed by representatives of all participating sectors and ministries in Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Environment in One Health and National Security</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/the-role-of-environment-in-one-health-and-national-security</link>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/the-role-of-environment-in-one-health-and-national-security</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The environment plays a crucial role in public health, yet it remains an underutilized partner for health security in most countries. P&amp;amp;R, with our USAID-funded partner project PREDICT, works with country governments to advocate for a stronger role for the environment in health security efforts - particularly to prevent and prepare for endemic, epidemic, pandemic, and other public health threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental and natural resource professionals collect data that can be used to obtain a comprehensive picture of the factors that affect human health. The data often collected includes weather forecasting to predict and inform vaccination campaigns and water quality monitoring for bacterial, algal, and inorganic contaminants that can cause human and animal illness, among many others. By utilizing data, expertise, and management approaches in the environmental sector, we can enhance our understanding of the root causes of diseases, better account for complexity of environmental factors, and ultimately encourage better management of natural resources for their health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environmental sector not only plays a role in early warning, detection, and identifying disease risk, it also plays a key role in response. For example, during the Ebola crisis in Liberia, environmental health professionals were responsible for dead body management. Expertise and infrastructure from environmental services serve as a valuable component of health security and as a result, environmental authorities must be engaged in national health security processes to maximize protection of the public’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the full joint brief on the role of environment in One Health and national health security, written with PREDICT as part of our joint advocacy efforts, on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/53083&quot;&gt;UNISDR Prevention web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/in-burundi-raising-awarenessneed-for-outbreak-preparedness-at-the-6th-east-african-health-and-scientific-conference</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 29-31, the 6th East African Health and Scientific Conference and International Health Exhibition and Trade Fair was held in Bujumbura, Burundi. The three-day conference fostered cooperation in the development and provision of quality health care through research, field experiences and sharing of data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s theme was “Preparedness for and Control of Disease Outbreaks, Epidemics, and Pandemics, in the Context of Climate Change, Globalization and Gaps in the Health System.” During the conference, P&amp;amp;R delivered two presentations at a USAID-moderated symposium, “Lessons Learnt from Ebola and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1, H5N8 Outbreaks: A Way Forward for Better and Effective Preparedness and Control of Outbreak,” where the project stressed the need to invest in outbreak prevention and strengthen regional and national capacities for infectious disease intelligence that allows for effective prevention, detection and response to public health threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was attended by the President of Burundi, His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza; the Minister of Health and Fight against Aids in Burundi, Honorable Josiane Nijimbere; the U.S Ambassador to Burundi, Anne Casper; and many other officials. USAID and other development agencies were also represented at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Nkurunziza emphasized the need for cooperation on health issues, especially since health is a major part of the country’s developmental agenda. Nkurunziza also announced that the headquarters of the East African Health Research Commission would be moving from Arusha, Tanzania to Bujumbura this year, and pledged his full support in ensuring a smooth and timely relocation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAID symposium, organized by P&amp;amp;R, fostered a greater understanding of the experiences and lessons learnt from East, Central and West African countries in preparedness and response to Ebola, HPAI H5N1 and H5N8. Dr. Andrew Kitua of P&amp;amp;R gave two keynote speeches, one on “Health Systems in Control of Outbreaks, Epidemics and Pandemics,” in which he highlighted strategies to strengthen the Preparedness and Response components of the health system and the role of the national One Health Platforms. The second keynote address was on the role of frontline health workers in preparedness and response to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next conference will be held in Tanzania in March 2019, and will present another opportunity for P&amp;amp;R to showcase and share lessons learned from its regional and country-specific activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One Health Policy Modeling in Ethiopia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/one-health-policy-modeling-in-ethiopia</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 03:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/one-health-policy-modeling-in-ethiopia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a request from the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, P&amp;amp;R developed an Interactive One Health policy modeling tool to generate information on the human, animal and environmental health effects of the massive livestock intensification planned under the country&amp;rsquo;s Livestock Master and Growth and Transformation plans. The One Health interactive tool was presented to Government of Ethiopia partners, preceded by a hands-on training on the use of the tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The One Health policy modeling tool includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, the footprint of livestock intensification on the availability of water, economic losses from decreased animal health, and the effect on Disability-Adjusted Life Years in human beings as a result of increased zoonotic disease incidence. The tool enables users to compare the impact of different interventions on disease prevalence both in animals and human beings, including other economic and environmental variables.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the tool can be applied for any disease of interest with little adaptation, inputs related to Brucellosis in cattle were used to show its impact both in cattle and human beings over a ten year period of forecast. However, one of the challenges faced in using the tool is due to lack of relevant and appropriate data, such as disease prevalence both in animals and humans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step, it was agreed that additional efforts should be made to further refine the tool, search for literature and other sources, and collect appropriate data on Brucellosis. A committee of four representatives, two each from Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries and Ministry of Health were selected to work on using the tool and specifically gather available data on Brucellosis and eventually produce a report, under P&amp;amp;R’s technical support, coordination and guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two day training workshop attracted a total of 17 representatives from the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries; Ministry of Health/Ethiopian Public Health Institute; Ethiopian Wildlife Authority; FAO, USAID and CDC, which greatly contributed to further refinement of the tool. The workshop was officially opened by Dr. Thomas Chernet, Policy advisor to the Minister of Livestock and Fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Key Government Partners Commit to Collaboration for Health Security in Indonesia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/key-government-partners-commit-to-collaboration-for-health-security-in-indonesia</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/key-government-partners-commit-to-collaboration-for-health-security-in-indonesia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 16, 2017, five government ministries in Indonesia affirmed their commitment to a One Health approach to address health security threats and outlined areas for joint action at a One Health Seminar held in Jakarta. The event, organized by FAO and supported by USAID, convened high-level officials and representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, and Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Culture with the objective of advancing a multilateral, multisectoral One Health approach to the prevention, detection, and response to threats to human and animal health, such as highly pathogenic infectious diseases or anti-microbial resistance (AMR). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Indonesia has been a member of the Global Health Security Agenda and in 2016, a lead country on the GHSA zoonotic disease action package with Vietnam. In his opening remarks, Hon. Hari Priyono, Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture, emphasized the country&amp;rsquo;s commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Global health security is a shared responsibility that cannot be achieved by a single actor or sector of government,&amp;rdquo; said the Secretary General. &amp;ldquo;Its success depends upon collaboration among the health, security, environment and agriculture sectors, using a One Health approach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar had a thematic focus on the threat posed by anti-microbial resistance (AMR) to public health, food security, and development progress overall – a prime example of a global health issue that cannot be solved by a single sector alone. Presenters and panel discussions raised the opportunities and promise of One Health as a holistic approach, but also noted the practical challenges of improving coordination and information sharing between the human health, animal health and environmental sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Brian McFeeters, Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy to Indonesia, underscored the need for “formal and informal mechanisms and structures for making and implementing decisions [on health security], which takes effort and time.” Dr. Naahli Kelsum, Assistant Deputy for Diseases Prevention and Response from the Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Culture, highlighted ongoing efforts by the Ministry and other government stakeholders, and supported by USAID Preparedness and Response (P&amp;amp;R) project, to institutionalize One Health and sustain multisectoral stakeholder collaboration for short- and long-term public health and food security. Dr. Naahli called all seminar participants to action. “[One Health] is not just a concept – now we need to implement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key stakeholders further affirmed their commitment to greater collaboration for health security in the issuance of a joint communique to media outlets and the general public, entitled, “Implementation of the One Health Approach in Indonesia with special emphasis on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).” This joint communique and One Health Seminar generated significant coverage by local news outlets including the Jakarta Globe, Kompas, and Antara News.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Multisectoral Collaboration for Disease Surveillance, Investigation, and Response in Rwanda</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/multisectoral-collaboration-with-existinginstitutional-frameworks</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:07:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/multisectoral-collaboration-with-existinginstitutional-frameworks</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the government of Rwanda adopted a 2014 - 2018 One Health Strategic Plan that reflects a shared commitment to enhance collaboration between environmental, animal, and human health sectors to address complex health challenges. Better collaboration leads to strengthened surveillance, early detection, rapid response, prevention, and control of zoonotic disease and other infectious disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, until now, not all these sectors were aware of how key technical and institutional frameworks for the country&amp;rsquo;s health system operated under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (TAHC). For sustainable multisectorial collaboration and coordination, each sector needed a better understanding of their partners&amp;#39; role disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, the Rwanda One Health Steering Committee, with technical assistance from P&amp;amp;R, organized and conducted a workshop on institutional frameworks and collaboration mechanisms in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and response, held in Kigali on February 21 - 22, 2017. This exercise helped to build a foundation for multisectoral collaboration on prevention, detection, and response to infectious disease among the sectors. A total of 23 representatives from different institutions of One Health collaboration - ministries, directorates, research and academic institutions, the World Health Organization (WHO), the FAO country office, and Rwanda OIE delegate took part in the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific outcomes included: 1) sharing institutional and technical frameworks of each of the ministries in dealing with disease surveillance, reporting, outbreak investigation, and response; 2) building awareness regarding WHO, FAO and OIE regulatory standards and code; 3) identifying areas, mechanisms and tools for multisectoral collaboration; and 4), developing a road map for the adoption of a multisectoral institutional framework for prevention, detection and response of zoonotic diseases and other public health threats - with adopting the framework as the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 2017, numerous dead wild birds were discovered on Uganda’s Lutembe Bay on Lake Victoria. These birds, and others including ducks and chickens identified in the Masaka District on January 13, 2017, tested positive for H5N8, one of the many subtypes of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) found worldwide but detected for the first time in the East Africa subregion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of HPAI in Uganda raises concerns because the country has a combination of factors that could contribute to further spread of the disease, including: a population of over forty million domestic poultry; a combination of a variety of informal trade of domestic poultry within the region, the presence of the disease in an area considered seasonal shelter of migratory birds that are reservoir of AI virus; the existence of numerous live bird markets; and a large number of backyard poultry producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Government of Uganda and other East African countries and their partners, including the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats 2 (EPT-2) program partners (e.g; FAO, PREDICT-2, One Health Workforce, and P&amp;amp;R)  are stepping up preparedness and response efforts to reduce the spread of H5N8 and prevent it from becoming an endemic disease within the subregion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Uganda activated the National Task Force (NTF) to manage its response, in coordination with the country’s recently established National One Health Platform’s secretariat, the Zoonotic Disease Coordination Office (ZDCO). The ZDCO provided technical guidance to the NTF on developing HPAI H5N8 outbreak response activities. Specifically, with the NTF, the ZDCO reviewed the draft Joint Emergency Response plan and budget; drafted a joint Cabinet Memorandum and press releases; and reviewed and updated existing Avian Influenza Communication Strategy documents and IEC materials in English and local languages in liaison with the Communications Subcommittee. P&amp;amp;R provided technical support to ZDCO throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, P&amp;amp;R Regional  and National One Health Technical Advisors are  also supporting preparedness and response actions in neighboring countries across East Africa. The Rwanda One Health Steering Committee has convened meetings with One Health stakeholders in the government, EPT-2 partners, local leaders, selected border posts, and national response teams in selected districts. The multi-sectoral team developed HPAI awareness messages to spread the word about the ongoing in-country preparedness, reporting channels, emergency contact numbers (in case of an outbreak or any detected sick or dead birds), and sensitization of communities and local leaders after identifying sites to enhance surveillance. One Health stakeholders are also currently reviewing the 2006 Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU) convened a national influenza taskforce meeting, bringing together One Health sector ministries, non-governmental and private sectors, and partners including FAO, WHO, OIE, WSU, ILRI, and PREDICT-2. As a result, the national influenza task force committees undertook rapid risk assessment, surveillance, and communication, as well as activated laboratory capabilities, resource mobilization, and coordination, in line with the Kenya Influenza Contingency Plan. P&amp;amp;R continues to provide technical assistance to the ZDU and multi-sectoral response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia, P&amp;amp;R consulted with various stakeholders, including members of the National One Health Steering Committee, Ethiopian Wildlife Authority, National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center, Epidemiology Directorate of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, EPT-2 partners, and FAO, to raise awareness and stimulate the initiation of preparedness actions While heightened surveillance has found no reported cases of HPAI, the Ethiopian Wildlife Authority has increased the monitoring of wetland wild bird activity in potential hot spots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tanzania, the One Health Coordination Unit (OHCU) established last year in the Prime Minister’s Office is coordinating preparedness and response actions. This coordination has improved multi-sectoral field monitoring of poultry and wild birds conducted by public health, wildlife, and veterinary services. Regular updates are being shared among stakeholders and emergency readiness exercises/simulations are ongoing. The OHCU has convened key sectors to develop a three-month HPAI contingency plan, which has been submitted to the cabinet of ministers for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning Before the Next Outbreak in Indonesia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/planning-for-coordination-before-an-outbreak-in-indonesia</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 23:01:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/planning-for-coordination-before-an-outbreak-in-indonesia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Jan. 25 – 27, over 80 district and provincial animal and human health, disaster agency, development and  planning agency, as well as police officials conducted a simulation exercise in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, to pilot One Health Coordination Guidelines in a non-emergency, or pre-outbreak, situation. Over the past six months, P&amp;amp;R has been supporting the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs (PMK-Komnas Zoonosis), in collaboration with FAO, to develop OH Coordination Guidelines to strengthen the provincial multi-sectoral coordination mechanism in both emergency and pre-outbreak situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier pilot of the Coordination Guidelines in an emergency situation was conducted with 30 provincial and district officials from December 19 - 21, 2016 in Pekanbaru, Riau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[This roll-out of the One Health Coordination Guidelines] is intended to highlight how critical rapid, accurate and effective coordinated action is,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Naalih Kelsum, MPH, Assistant Deputy for Diseases Prevention and Respond, Ministry of Human Development and Cultural Affairs, during his opening remarks. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s critical for the prevention and response in the emergency pandemic situation - both at national and sub-national levels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the lessons learned from these two pilots, the OH Coordination Guidelines will be finalized and presented for governmental endorsement for nationwide implementation by mid-2017. Following governmental endorsement, P&amp;amp;R will work with key One Health stakeholders in country to expand implementation of these guidelines among animal health, human health and environmental officials, at the national level and across Indonesia’s 34 provinces. Standardized and sustained effective coordination and communications mechanisms are key for not only responding to, but also preventing, future outbreaks of recurring or emerging infectious diseases that negatively impact human health and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Responding to Avian Influenza in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/responding-to-avian-influenza-in-bangladesh</link>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/responding-to-avian-influenza-in-bangladesh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Jan 15, a poultry die-off was observed on a poultry farm in Dhamrai subdistrict near Dhaka, Bangladesh, and reported by local farmers to the Department of Livestock Services.  An investigation confirmed 732 deaths among a flock of 3000 chickens and lab testing confirmed contamination with H5N1 virus, a subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, samples from dead house crows found at the Rajshahi Medical College and Dhaka Medical College initially confirmed positive for H5N1 using a Rapid Antigen Detection test (RAT). Bangladesh had not reported any official outbreak of HPAI in poultry since 2014.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To its credit, and thanks to the support of the EPT-2 partners, the Government of Bangladesh responded quickly. On Jan 18, a meeting of the National Technical Committee (Livestock Sector) was convened by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) to review the outbreak situation. Chaired by the Director General of DLS, the meeting included participants from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Directorate General of Health Services), Bangladesh Forest Department, Bangladesh Agricultural University, ICDDR/B, FAO, P&amp;amp;R, and other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With partners, the government noted that while the numbers in the outbreaks were comparatively low, other recent surveillance data has reflected the continuous circulation of HPAI in Bangladesh. A recent study by FAO collected samples from arrival, slaughter, and exposure areas from 104 live bird markets in Dhaka, and found that 90 turned initial positive indicators for HPAI.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has concluded that HPAI is endemic in the country, and began to plan for both eradication and prevention of spillover. They called for a new vaccination policy and an updating of the AI preparedness and response plan, beginning with a specific plan for cleaning and disinfection of the live bird markets. P&amp;amp;R will continue to support outbreak response and the government’s efforts as they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/investigating-an-anthrax-outbreak-in-tanzania</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a request from the Government of Tanzania through the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Children and Elderly, P&amp;amp;R provided technical support, coordination and facilitation of a multi-sectoral investigation of an Anthrax outbreak in Arusha, Tanzania.  Anthrax is one of the key zoonotic diseases for which cross-sectoral collaboration among animal, human and environmental health sectors is both feasible and essential for effective prevention and control. P&amp;amp;R&amp;rsquo;s technical support was designed to facilitate the nascent One Health Coordination Unit (OHCU) to lead multi-sectoral coordination exercises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R focused on providing technical advice in the outbreak management approach, facilitating planning meetings, supporting travel to the field, facilitating documentation of how the district, region and nation were prepared for the outbreak. Human, animal and environmental health experts jointly planned, carried out field investigations and made recommendations to the national taskforce cutting across all One Health sectors. Cross border districts representatives from Kenya were engaged in this process on how to stop the disease from spreading across the border, with financial assistance from the World Bank.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collaborative effort provided first-hand experience to the OHCU on the significance of effective preparedness and response mechanisms. The outbreak investigation identified salient risk factors, impacts and potential interventions for the development of a long term prevention and control strategy for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updating Ebola Virus Disease Preparedness and Response Plans in Liberia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/updating-ebola-virus-disease-preparedness-and-response-plans-in-liberia</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/updating-ebola-virus-disease-preparedness-and-response-plans-in-liberia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frequently, emerging pandemic threats begin as local public health events (PHE). A PHE is an occurence that results in serious illness, has the capacity to spread, and requires a coordinated response. Without a coordinated response, critical delays occur in detection, reporting, investigation, and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Liberia has worked closely with partner organizations like P&amp;amp;R to update their existing Ebola-specific preparedness and response plans to better respond to future public health events of an initially unknown etiology. The World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s (WHO) PHE framework serves as a concise technical and managerial guiding document for multi-sectoral preparedness and response to public health events. P&amp;amp;R uses the framework as a tool to help countries understand where they have capacity gaps, while also showing them the value of a coordinated One Health approach to outbreak preparedness and response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This December, the P&amp;amp;R national One Health advisor in Liberia (NOHTSA) provided technical expertise in the design and development of a Liberian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)-organized workshop, funded by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), to upgrade existing Ebola virus disease preparedness and response plans. The upgrades included expanding them into multi-hazard plans and better integrating multi-sector One Health coordination and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P&amp;amp;R NOHTA presented and served as a co-facilitator, alongside experts from the Armed Forces of Liberia and UNMIL. More than 80 representatives from 15 counties participated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting the Agenda for Global Health Security in Lao PDR</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/setting-the-agenda-for-global-health-security-in-lao</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 08:24:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/setting-the-agenda-for-global-health-security-in-lao</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of USAID&amp;rsquo;s support for the US Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), P&amp;amp;R is providing ongoing technical assistance in the development and implementation of the National GHSA Roadmap - which sets key targets for 2021 across different action packages, including countering antimicrobial resistance, strengthening surveillance, establishing emergency operations centers, expanding a skilled global health security workforce, and building a whole-of-government approach to biosafety and biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lao PDR currently faces many high-risk disease threats, including cross-border infectious and emerging diseases that can pass from animals to humans, particularly during periods of development and environmental stress. The complex nature of these health threats requires infrastructure, equipment, a skilled workforce, and coordination among government agencies, the private sector, and civil society in order to respond effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 21-22, P&amp;amp;R facilitated a two-day workshop, convening over 120 representatives from government agencies and international organizations, to assist the Lao government in the formation and implementation of its National Five-Year Global Health Security Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We congratulate Laos on its longstanding leadership in preparedness for emerging disease threats,&amp;rdquo; said USAID Laos Country Office Director Alexandria Huerta, &amp;ldquo;and for working across sectors to develop the GHSA Roadmap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate next step before the plan goes into effect is to seek governmental endorsement by the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Forestry, anticipated to take place in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a One Health Framework in West Africa</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/building-a-one-health-framework-in-west-africa</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 23:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/building-a-one-health-framework-in-west-africa</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2016, USAID co-sponsored One Health Technical and Ministerial Meetings in Dakar, with the West African Health Organization (WAHO) arm of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE). The goal of the workshop was to foster the institutionalization and the ownership of the One Health approach in all participating West African countries to improve regional prevention, detection and response to emerging infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the preparation for the Dakar meetings, P&amp;amp;R country national One Health Advisors worked with WHO, FAO, OIE and CDC to share One Health information, provide additional guidance, and work with country delegates from different ministries to meet and jointly prepare their participation as a country team. In Guinea, P&amp;amp;R organized, with the WHO, a joint pre-meeting workshop to share with members of the delegation the objectives of the approach in the country. In Mali, P&amp;amp;R responded to government and USAID requests for P&amp;amp;R to support the revision and update of the national zoonotic disease policy and plan, and facilitated a stakeholders’ orientation and consultative workshop in which members of Mali delegation participated and contributed to the development of a consensus on a national One Health framework and an operational plan for its implementation. In Cote d’Ivoire, P&amp;amp;R identified participants from stakeholder ministries, and helped define the country’s multisectoral progress made toward establishing a GHSA and One Health coordination platform. In Sierra Leone and Liberia, P&amp;amp;R developed briefing presentations for the delegations on One Health for each of the breakout sessions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Dakar meeting, P&amp;amp;R has also worked with WAHO on supporting ECOWAS in strengthening national and regional mechanisms for surveillance, early warning, preparedness and response to epidemics. WAHO, as one of the main components of the new ECOWAS Regional Centre for Disease Surveillance and Control, had decided to establish an ECOWAS Regional Rapid Response Team (ERRRT), with P&amp;amp;R providing important technical and facilitation support to organize an ERRRT Team Building Workshop. More than 100 delegates from 15 countries and partner organizations, including CDC, WHO, FAO, OIE, and the African Union reviewed and developed a consensus on the ERRRT composition, terms of references (TOR), standard operating procedures (SOPs), and resources needed during pre-deployment, deployment and recovery phases. P&amp;amp;R also designed and facilitated a tabletop simulation exercise on regional cross-border response to a zoonotic disease outbreak, providing guidance on ways to integrate the One Health approach throughout the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the success of the ERRRT development and the November technical and ministerial meetings, P&amp;amp;R will continue to provide guidance to WAHO as it develops the ECOWAS One Health implementation framework – and support individual countries in implementing the action plan – to build a truly regional multisectoral mechanism for West Africa in the prevention, detection and response to a public health event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Grassroots Movement to Government Priority - One Health in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/from-grassroots-movement-to-government-priority-one-health-in-bangladesh</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 22:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/from-grassroots-movement-to-government-priority-one-health-in-bangladesh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In population-dense Bangladesh, infectious diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, such as avian influenza, pose a serious public health threat. Environmental stress and a rapidly expanding livestock industry compound the threat, putting people’s health and livelihoods at risk.As in many countries, officials and technical experts involved in addressing disease outbreaks are dispersed across human, veterinary, agriculture, environment and wildlife health sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need for multidisciplinary collaboration across these sectors is fundamental to the “One Health” approach to controlling outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza or new pathogens that may not be known. For these reasons, the USAID-funded Preparedness and Response (P&amp;amp;R) project is working with FAO and the Government of Bangladesh to advance the country’s emergent One Health movement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2008, One Health Bangladesh was a response to the country’s first outbreak of avian influenza the year prior. The effort involved several consultations among stakeholders from government, non-governmental organizations, academia and civil society. In 2012, One Health Bangladesh developed a Strategic Framework for One Health that was, over the next three years, endorsed by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. With governmental endorsement, the goal now is to institutionalize One Health in Bangladesh by building a mechanism or “platform” to support effective coordination and information sharing across human, animal, and environmental health sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, USAID P&amp;amp;R, One Health Bangladesh, and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research brought together representatives from government agencies in health, livestock and environment; World Health Organization; Food and Agriculture Organization; U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and other partners to create a roadmap for institutionalizing One Health. Just two months later, a formal decision was made to establish a One Health Secretariat and Steering Committee. To be formally adopted by the Government of Bangladesh is a remarkable milestone and affirmation of One Health in Bangladesh, from its humble beginning as a voluntary movement in 2008. Following this decision, in September, USAID P&amp;amp;R and FAO convened 60 One Health champions and stakeholders in Dhaka to draft Terms of Reference for the One Health Secretariat and Steering Committee. This meeting marks an important milestone toward achieving a proactive, sustained approach to pressing health challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps include finalizing the Terms of Reference and identifying resources to support the One Health Secretariat. USAID will continue its support for a strong and sustainable One Health mechanism in Bangladesh that promotes dynamic and effective collaboration. To be certain, cross-sectoral coordination for preventive action and efficient response to disease outbreaks can make all the difference when lives and livelihoods are on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
