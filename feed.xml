      <description>&lt;p&gt;This April, P&amp;amp;R, in collaboration with One Health Bangladesh and Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), held a consultative workshop on the operational aspects of One Health institutionalization in Bangladesh. The workshop included 33 participants from government agencies in health, livestock, and environment, as well as other development partners such as USAID, CDC, WHO, FAO and PREDICT-2. Together, they clarified the objectives and process of institutionalizing OH and brainstormed on the nature, composition, staffing, financing, and legal framework of the One Health secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first part of the workshop, two speakers provided the goals and overview of One Health movement. Dr. Mahmudur Rahman, IEDCR Director, presented the evolution, importance and progress of the movement in the country. He also highlighted the need for the institutionalization of One Health to ensure sustainability. Meanwhile, Dr. Nitish Debnath, One Health Coordinator for FAO Bangladesh, provided an overview of the Strategic Framework, with a focus on institutionalization and governance. He emphasized the need for the strategy to be realized, given the ever increasing threats of emerging infectious and zoonotic disease, as well as in capitalizing new developments and opportunities such as GHSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bangladesh_operations.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bangladesh_operations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshop participants discuss secretariat structure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R Director Jerry Martin also clarified what what the project can do to assist the countries by adapting to their needs and challenges. Together with Dr. Pasakorn Akarasewi, the P&amp;amp;R Southeast Asia Regional Director, they shared experiences in working and supporting One Health in the countries of Kenya and Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking out into three groups, participants were tasked with outlining secretariat: functions, staffing and line of command; funding arrangements; location; legal framework; and the composition of the expert advisory group. The enthusiastic and lively discussions within the groups generated lots of ideas and recommendations regarding the questions posed to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outputs, ideas and recommendations of the workshop will be incorporated into the working papers for the May 2016 inter-ministerial meeting to develop the secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Animal and Human Health Surveillance in Liberia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/animal-and-human-health-surveillance-in-liberia</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 19:48:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/animal-and-human-health-surveillance-in-liberia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Bank will be providing the Government of Liberia with a $30 million line of credit through REDISSE to support animal and human health surveillance, preparedness and response, and laboratory capacity.  At the REDISSE Workshop, P&amp;amp;R, in conjunction with PREDICT2, ensured that wildlife and animal health were considered in the planning for new national surveillance systems and that animal health and wildlife professionals would be included as part of Rapid Response Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R worked with Liberia’s Forest Development Authority (FDA), which oversees wildlife, to participate in REDISSE planning at the suggestion of the ministries of Health and Agriculture. P&amp;amp;R also conducted a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis for the REDISSE proposal to identify surveillance and preparedness gaps and suggest surveillance systems that could be used within the FDA system. P&amp;amp;R also assisted Ministry of Agriculture in identifying its priorities within the available REDISSE funding and develop a one-year work plan. P&amp;amp;R facilitated meetings with the ministries of Health, Agriculture and others to reduce cost and realize efficiencies in integrating animal health surveillance and laboratory data into a human health information platform currently being piloted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Liberia is a country with significant needs. The ministries of Agriculture and Health and the Forestry Development Authority have expressed their commitment to One Health; however, at this time, Agriculture and Forestry cannot act as equal partners to the Ministry of Health as neither organization has the data, trained personnel, or logistical resources to contribute to One Health collaborative activities. On the other hand, multiple funding sources are supporting Ministry of Health’s health systems strengthening including in surveillance, laboratory capacity, and preparedness and response. Agriculture and Forestry need substantial investments to build their systems and their capabilities to prepare for outbreak events, prevent on-going animal health issues, provide accurate and timely surveillance data, and respond to events once they occur.  With respect to animal health issues, each organization is under resourced and lack capacity.  Specifically, neither has an active surveillance system, a fully operational veterinary laboratory, and the capacity to readily respond to an outbreak.  In addition, they lack animal health personnel; there is only one veterinarian at the Ministry of Agriculture and none at the FDA. In the coming months, P&amp;amp;R will work with the Government of Liberia to establish a One Health Steering Committee and support the inclusion of One Health in other existing initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Policy and Advocacy Strategy in Kenya</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/building-a-policy-and-advocacy-strategy-in-kenya</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/building-a-policy-and-advocacy-strategy-in-kenya</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2006-2007, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in East Africa killed approximately 500 people and infected more than 200,000. In Kenya alone, the outbreak cost $32 million in livestock losses and international export bans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Now, another outbreak appears possible this year due to extreme rainfall from El Niño.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak prompted Kenya to organize national assets against future epidemics. With assistance from the CDC and USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threats program, the country established a One Health platform—the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). While the platform enjoyed broad acceptance, the group was provided little funding and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with assistance from P&amp;amp;R, the ZDU is actively building its capacity and its case for legislative support and funding. On March 2-3, P&amp;amp;R technical specialists organized and conducted a policy advocacy and communication workshop in Nairobi. Twenty-nine participants from ministries and partner organizations met under the leadership of the ZDU to draft an advocacy strategy and action plan. These same stakeholders met March 14–15, with P&amp;amp;R leading another workshop to develop the ZDU’s preparedness and response plan to a public health emergency of initially unknown etiology. In May, the ZDU will present a final advocacy strategy and action plan to the Zoonotic Technical Working Group (ZTWG), the ZDU’s steering committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With assistance from P&amp;amp;R, the ZDU will deliver advocacy and messaging to senior government officials and the private sector later this year, so these key decision makers fully understand the necessity of the One Health approach in Kenya. The goal of the advocacy strategy is that, with this increased understanding, decision makers and the private sector will be willing to provide additional financial, technical, and/ or human resources to the One Health Platform. This will not only strengthen the platform’s efforts to better detect and respond to emerging pandemics, but also increase its domestic financing, helping make the platform more sustainable and less reliant on donor funding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessing One Health Surveillance Training in Indonesia</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/assessing-one-health-training-in-indonesia</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 20:06:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/assessing-one-health-training-in-indonesia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the USAID-funded RESPOND project conducted training in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, on “Integrated Surveillance Training on Control of Zoonotic Diseases based on One Health Approach.” In February 2016, the P&amp;amp;R team returned to review the results of this training with the provincial government and to learn about an unanticipated positive outcome—participants from North Toraja had established a local One Health platform (KOMDA) on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2014 training convened senior agricultural and health staff from South Sulawesi and was conducted in the districts of Maros and North Toraja. Curriculum included: early outbreak identification and response; notifiable and zoonotic disease reporting; sample collection and trans-port; use of personal protective equipment; and sharing of surveillance information. The curriculum included activities and collaboration exercises by public health and animal health workers.
The review found the multi-sectoral, experiential training was one of four factors that prompted the establishment of the KOMDA. Leadership from the North Toraja Department of Social Wel-fare and the District Development Planning Agency and a Presidential decree on the framework were also factors. The review recommended a pre-training needs assessment, including officials from planning and finance, and expanding stakeholder participation.
Since the North Toraja Bupati, or regional leader, issued a decree establishing a KOMDA, it has met every three months. There has been increased sharing of information between human and animal health practitioners. According to Ibu Marseni, a veterinarian from the North Toraja Livestock Office and KOMDA member, the number of rabies cases has decreased despite an increase in dog bites. Reports are now shared with a public health and animal health worker. 
Overall, P&amp;amp;R found that after the training, there was improved awareness about One Health, an appreciation of the mixture of district and sub-district participants, and an increase in linkages between the levels. Respondents recommended that training be extended to include represen-tatives of all sub-districts in a target district, and that the training be extended to village level.
Since completion of the training in early 2014, the modules and field experiences developed have been adopted by Ministry of Health’s National Training Center of Ciloto (early 2016), and will be adapted as a national training module in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture’s Animal Health Training Center of Cinagara, and EPT2 partner, INDOHUN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strengthening Regional Capability by Engaging the East African Community Secretariat</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/engaging-the-east-african-community-secretariat</link>

      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/engaging-the-east-african-community-secretariat</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 21st and 22nd, USAID P&amp;amp;R Africa Regional Deputy Director Serge Nzietcheung and USAID EPT-2 East Africa Advisor Lisa Kramer had a first engagement meeting with representatives of Human Health and Agriculture sectors at the East African Community Secretariat (EAC) at Arusha, Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting identified two potential areas of collaboration aligned with P&amp;amp;R objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Institutionalize and operationalize One Health Approach at East African Community 
• Support East African Community Partner States to enhance national one health preparedness and response plans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion is ongoing, by February 6th 2016, P&amp;amp;R will inform the EAC secretariat on activities to support. Following that, P&amp;amp;R will present these activities to the Ambassador, Secretary General of East African Community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planning Epidemic Response in Cameroon</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/planning-epidemic-response-in-cameroon</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2016 19:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/planning-epidemic-response-in-cameroon</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding ways to work together is crucial to Cameroon, a country at high risk for zoonotic disease emergence and re-emergence because of its range of human-animal-environmental interactions. Cameroon has endured a fatal outbreak of anthrax in great apes (gorillas and chimpanzees) in late 2004 and early 2005 in the Dja Biosphere Reserve; and three wild bird H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in the north. P&amp;amp;R is working with Cameroon’s One Health Platform—the National Zoonotic Program (NZP)&amp;ndash;to operationalize multisectoral responses to these threats, helping Cameroon become a leader of One Health in Central Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February P&amp;amp;R led a workshop with the NZP where participants identified ways to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in areas such as disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and response. While the workshop was going on, an inter-ministerial meeting was called by the Prime Minister following a request from the President to know the country’s level of preparedness for avian influenza, following recent outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in three regions in Nigeria bordering Cameroon. The Prime Minister assigned the task of updating Cameroon’s 2006 AI preparedness plan to the NZP, confirming that he recognized the NZP as the coordination mechanism responsible for preparedness and response to pandemic threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, the Permanent Secretariat of the NZP, supported by P&amp;amp;R and CDC, led a zoonotic diseases prioritization exercise with the ministries of: Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industry; Forestry and Wildlife; Public Health; and Environment, Protection of Nature and Sustainable Development. Together, officials from these ministries identified five priority zoonotic diseases that most threaten their country’s public health, including three specific emerging pandemic threats: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI-H5N1) and the Ebola and Marburg viral hemorrhagic fevers. Through this agreement, these separate ministries deepened their commitment to working together to prevent deadly zoonotic diseases and respond quickly and in coordination should an outbreak occur, with the NZP leading the One Health platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these events, P&amp;amp;R also worked with the NZP in March to address the Prime Minister’s mandate—to plan an inter-sectoral workshop in early April to review Cameroon’s existing avian influenza contingency plan and develop a new preparedness and response plan drawing on the expertise and resources of all relevant ministries and other stakeholders. Once the plan is drafted, P&amp;amp;R expects to help the NZP test it through a simulation before rolling it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discussing Challenges and Results at Central and East Africa’s One Health Conference</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/challenges-commitments-at-central-and-east-africas-one-health-conference</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2015 18:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/challenges-commitments-at-central-and-east-africas-one-health-conference</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Dr. Monica Musenero, now Assistant Commissioner of Epidemiology and Surveillance for the Ministry of Health in Uganda, was at the forefront of the global H5N1 pandemic crisis. She had recently been recruited as project manager of USAID’s H5N1 response program, and was tasked with pulling together a team of specialists to respond to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I decided we needed everyone at the table – veterinarians, wildlife specialists, biologists, zoologists, entymologists, everyone,” said Dr. Musenero in describing the challenges the program faced. “USAID had used a multi-disciplinary response in other countries, and it had been successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a relatively low incidence of H5N1 in Uganda, the program’s task force used their lessons learned from H5N1 preparedness to focus on other zoonotic disease threats, including yersinia pestis – a disease better known as the plague. Together, the task force designed inexpensive, easy-to-implement programs focused on prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2007, in a year, deaths from yersinia pestis in Uganda dropped from almost seven thousand to almost none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following her experience on the project, Dr. Musenero became an evangelist for the One Health approach - a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach used to address health challenges from zoonotic diseases, like H5N1 and other pandemic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories just like Dr. Musenero’s have brought hundreds of global health leaders in Africa to meet for their second annual conference in Kampala on Monday, November 16. The conference, organized by the One Health Central and East Africa association (OHCEA), is designed to share best practices for the One Health approach among global health, medicine, veterinary, environment and other technical professionals, as well as officials and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the conference is the question - in every country, health programs and approaches are competing for limited resources. How can the technical professionals best promote the One Health approach to leaders and policymakers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know the approach works, because we’ve used it successfully in the field,” said Dr. Musenero. “I’ve made the analogy – One Health is like our girlfriend. It’s time to make it our wife. We need to make it legal and permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of building an effective and sustainable approach to One Health at a national level was exactly the focus of Wednesday’s conference panel, hosted by USAID’s Preparedness &amp;amp; Response (P&amp;amp;R) project. The panel brought together six One Health leaders from five Central and East African countries, including Dr. Musenero, to share the challenges and lessons learned of the One Health platforms in their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel’s keynote address was given by the Honorable Dr. Rwamirama Brith, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries in Rwanda, who emphasized the importance of regional and international cooperation in response to emerging pandemic threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are ready to learn from, and work with, our neighbors, because these threats are transboundary in nature,” said the Honorable Dr. Brith in his closing remarks. “Just as no one sector can address these diseases on their own, no one country can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Monique Ouli Ndongo, a One Health champion in Cameroon who helped develop a platform widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive in Africa, presented on the structure of the secretariat in her country. She was followed by Dr. Kariuki Njenga, founder of the technical coordinating body the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU) in Kenya, who highlighted the contrast between the two countries’ approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One Health platforms cannot be a ‘one size fits all’ approach,” said Lisa Kramer, USAID Regional Advisor of the Emerging Pandemic Threats program and panel moderator. “Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages, and it’s important to share that information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their presentations were followed by Dr. Musenero, who spoke movingly about both her experiences as a One Health advocate in Uganda and her service as an epidemiologist in Sierra Leone on the front line of the 2014 Ebola outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/small.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;small&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Musenero, presenting at the conference&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Professionally, we were caught off-guard,” said Dr. Musenero of the outbreak. “The level of competence at both the national and international level has been tested, and found wanting…we needed more expertise on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Musenero was followed by Dr. Robinson Mdegela, who outlined the One Health strategy being developed in Tanzania. Panelists also responded to questions from the 50+ high-level One Health experts from across Africa attending the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants emphasized the need for coordination in establishing a One Health approach in their country. Many had worked with USAID’s P&amp;amp;R project directly to further develop a platform for the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know that you can have the best research, the best training, the best systems at the university level,” said Serge Nzietcheung, the P&amp;amp;R project’s Deputy Director in Africa during the panel’s opening remarks. “But if you don’t have the government capacity, structure, policies and laws to support their work, the One Health approach won’t be effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R, with PREDICT and One Health Workforce, is part of the suite of projects under the second phase of USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT-2) program. The mandate of the P&amp;amp;R project is to establish or strengthen One Health platforms in 21 target countries across Africa and Asia. P&amp;amp;R accomplishes that mandate both by facilitating opportunities, such as this panel, for technical professionals, leaders and policymakers to share information. The project also provides direct consultation to country governments on issues such as One Health organizational development, institutional capacity building, and policy advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The P&amp;amp;R project has been extraordinarily helpful in developing the platform in Cameroon,” said Senator Ndongo, on her experience working with the project. “Their technical expertise has given us the background to shape a lot of decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, a lack of technical expertise in government remains an obstacle for a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary response to emerging pandemic threats. One of the most frequent challenges encountered was simply a lack of commitment at the leadership level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a challenge to approach health officials in the government – people who are dealing with HIV, malaria, tuberculosis – and convince them that zoonotic diseases should be a priority, because there might be an outbreak at some point in the future,” said Dr. Njenga, talking about some of the obstacles he had faced. “But in 2014, we were confronted with that future directly.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hosting Country Government Representatives for International One Health Workshop</title>
      <link>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/one-health-workshop</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 13:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Preparedness and Response Staff</author>
      <guid>http://preparednessandresponse.org/news/one-health-workshop</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Preparedness and Response (P&amp;amp;R) project brought together 30 representatives from 10 countries to learn what the project and its partners are doing to build national and regional One Health capacity to emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jerry_meeting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;jerry_meeting&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Health seeks to integrate multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. Participants represented their countries’ various ministries of human health, environment, and animal health—the three pillars of the One Health approach. P&amp;amp;R has a dual mandate to help countries design and implement national preparedness and response plans for public health events of unknown etiology and to establish and strengthen National One Health Platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-day conference featured 10 speakers and maximum time for networking and sharing lessons learned. The USAID Predict 2 project—which works to shift the prevention and surveillance of disease outbreaks towards identification and mitigation of viral spillover—and the USAID One Health Workforce—which supports One Health university networks to participate with government and other key partners in defining one health workforce needs—also presented to participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference participants benefitted most from the shared experiences. “We are going to go back home and try to address the issues of One Health in a holistic approach,” said Janneth Mghamba of Tanzania’s Ministry of Health and Human Welfare. “Rather than working in silos, all the sectors need to work together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another participant stressed the importance of each sector trusting the other. “In Thailand, we have two key words: talk and trust. After meetings of the three sectors, we need to talk and discuss like friends. And because each of our organizations have different cultures, we need to be able to trust each other and act upon information shared,” said Soawapak Hinjoy of Thailand’s Bureau of Epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAID P&amp;amp;R project is one component of the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT 2) program. EPT2 has three overarching purposes: the prevention of the spillover, amplification, and spread of new and re-emerging zoonotic viruses; early detection of new viruses when they emerge; and their timely and effective control. EPT2 is part of the Obama Administration’s Global Health Security Agenda, which brings together U.S. government agencies and other national governments to address natural and manmade disease threats worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the workshop, participants articulated their specific country needs that the P&amp;amp;R team plans to address. “This workshop has been invaluable to the P&amp;amp;R team as we begin to launch activities in more than 20 countries in Southeast Asia and Africa,” said Chief of Party Jerry Martin. “The Ebola outbreak demonstrates the enormous human and economic costs that pandemic threats can inflict in the absence of strong preparedness and response systems. P&amp;amp;R is focused on helping these countries address these gaps in a sustainable and effective manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
